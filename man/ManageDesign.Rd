\arguments{
\item{context}{A \code{ManageContext} or inherited class object representing
the context of a biosecurity management resource allocation design.}

\item{divisions}{A \code{bsdesign::Divisions} or inherited class object
representing one or more divisions (management responses, strategies,
invasion pathways, invasive species, spatial locations, time, etc.) for
the management design.}

\item{dim_type}{The type of dimension that the management resources are
allocated across. One of \code{"spatial"} locations (default),
\code{"temporal"}, \code{"spatiotemporal"}, invasive \code{"species"},
invasion \code{"pathways"}, \code{"strategies"}, management
\code{"responses"}, or other user defined. The dimensions should be
appropriately configured via the \code{divisions} object.}

\item{establish_pr}{A vector of (relative) probability values to represent
the likelihood of pest establishment at each division part specified by
\code{divisions}. Default is \code{NULL}. Values are assumed to be
relative when their maximum is greater than 1, or an attribute
\code{relative = TRUE} is attached to the parameter.}

\item{optimal}{The strategy used for finding an effective management
resource allocation. One of (maximum) \code{"saving"} (or cost-dependent
benefit), (maximum) \code{"benefit"} (independent of management resource
costs), (maximum) number of management \code{"successes"}, or (maximum)
overall system-wide \code{"effectiveness"} (probability of success), or
\code{"none"} for representing existing management resource allocation
designs only. Maximum \code{"effectiveness"} can only be used when actual
(not relative) establishment probability (\code{establish_pr}) values are
provided.}

\item{alloc_unit}{The descriptive unit to describe allocated management
resource quantities. One of \code{"units"}, \code{"hours"},
\code{"traps"}, \code{"treatments"}, \code{"removals"}, or user specified.}

\item{cost_unit}{The descriptive unit to describe allocated management
resource costs, cost-based benefit savings, and/or other costs when
applicable. One of \code{"$"}, \code{"hours"}, or user specified.}

\item{benefit}{A vector of values quantifying the benefit (or cost-based
saving) associated with allocated management resources at each division
part specified by \code{divisions}. Default is \code{NULL}. When the
benefit refers to cost-based savings (i.e. \code{optimal} is
\code{"saving"}), then the units should be consistent with the
\code{cost_unit} parameter.}

\item{alloc_cost}{A vector of cost per unit of allocated management
resources at each division part specified by \code{divisions}. Default is
\code{NULL}. Units should be consistent with the \code{cost_unit}
parameter.}

\item{budget}{The cost budget or constraint for the resource allocation in
the management design. Default is \code{NULL}. Units should be consistent
with \code{alloc_cost} when specified. Otherwise the units should be
consistent with the \code{alloc_unit} parameter.}

\item{average_pr}{The desired (minimum) weighted average probability of
success (or effectiveness) of the management design (e.g. 0.95). The
weighted average is calculated using (relative) establishment probability
(\code{establish_pr}) values. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{overall_pr}{The desired (minimum) overall system-wide probability of
success (or effectiveness) of the management design (e.g. 0.95). Can only
be used when actual (not relative) establishment probability
(\code{establish_pr}) values are provided. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{exist_alloc}{A vector of existing management resource quantities at
each division part specified by \code{divisions}. Should only be used to
represent existing management resource allocation designs when
\code{optimal = "none"}. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{exist_manage_pr}{A vector, or list of vectors, of probability of
success (or effectiveness) values for existing management resources at
each division part specified by \code{divisions}. Multiple existing
management success probabilities may be specified in a list. Default is
\code{NULL}.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters.}
}
\value{
A \code{ManageDesign} class object (list) containing functions for
allocating resources, and calculating (unit and overall) likely management
success probabilities (or effectiveness):
\describe{
\item{\code{get_context()}}{Get context object.}
\item{\code{get_divisions()}}{Get divisions object.}
\item{\code{get_dim_type()}}{Get dimension type.}
\item{\code{get_cost_unit()}}{Get cost unit.}
\item{\code{get_allocation()}}{Get allocated resources via specified
strategy, utilizing savings, benefits, budget constraints, and/or
desired overall management success probability level.}
\item{\code{get_manage_pr()}}{Get the probability of success (or
effectiveness) values at each division part for the allocated
management design, combined with any existing success probabilities or
effectiveness specified via \code{exist_manage_pr}.}
\item{\code{get_average_pr()}}{Get the weighted average probability
of success (or effectiveness) of the management design. Weighted via
\code{establish_pr} values.}
\item{\code{get_overall_pr()}}{Get the overall system-wide probability
of success (or effectiveness) of the management design. Only available
when actual (not relative) \code{establish_pr} values are provided.}
\item{\code{save_design(...)}}{Save the management design as a
collection of raster TIF and/or comma-separated value (CSV) files,
appropriate for the \code{divisions} type, including the management
resource \code{allocation}, the probability of management success (or
effectiveness) values (\code{manage_pr}), \code{manage_cost} (combined
allocation and fixed costs), and a \code{summary} (CSV) of the total
allocation, costs (when applicable), the weighted average probability
of success (\code{average_pr}), and (when available) the overall
system-wide probability of success (or effectiveness) of the
management design (\code{overall_pr}). \code{Terra} raster write
options may be passed to the function for saving grid-based designs.}

\description{
Builds a base class to represent management design functionality for the
effective allocation of management resources across one or more divisions
(management responses, strategies, invasion pathways, invasive species,
spatial locations, time, etc.) via methods that utilize management costs,
savings, benefits, and/or overall management probability of success (or
effectiveness).
