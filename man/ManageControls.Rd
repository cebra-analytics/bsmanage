\usage{
ManageControls(region, population_model, stages = NULL, ...)

\method{ManageControls}{Region}(region, population_model, stages = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{region}{A \code{bsspread::Region} or inherited class object
representing the spatial region (template) for the incursion management
simulations.}

\item{population_model}{A \code{bsspread::Population} or inherited class
object defining the population representation for the management
simulations.}

\item{stages}{Numeric vector of population stages (indices) to which
management controls are applied. Default is all stages (when set to
\code{NULL}).}

\item{...}{Additional parameters.}
}
\value{
A \code{ManageControls} class object (list) containing a function
for accessing attributes and applying simulated management controls:
\describe{
\item{\code{get_type()}}{Get the type of management action ("control").}
\item{\code{get_stages()}}{Get the population stages to which management
actions are applied.}
\item{\code{apply(n)}}{Apply management controls to a simulated
population vector or matrix \code{n}, potentially with attached
attributes relating to previously applied actions, and return the
resulting population \code{n} along with attached attributes relating
to the newly applied controls.}
}
}
\description{
Builds a class for simulating the application of invasive species management
controls, such as suppressing growth, fertility, spread, or establishment.
